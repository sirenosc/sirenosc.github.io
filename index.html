			<h1>Siren: Multi-oscillator Drone Generator</h1>

			<div class="blabla">
                Siren is a digital stereo module packing 21 oscillators and 23
                LFOs to generate lush drones. Macro controls set their
                respective pitch, waveform, and amplitude. Siren is not meant
                to be the tool you reach for when wanting to write explicit
                chord progressions and harmonies. Instead, the few provided
                macro controls make a wide parameter space accessible and fun
                to explore. Find sweet spots of your liking by the turn of a
                knob and add subtle modulation to find new musical ideas and
                progressions. Use rhythmically related control voltages to
                explore a vast world of weird musical progressions that fall
                between the cracks of the discrete nature of music theory.

                Siren is a digital module and does very little to hide this
                heritage. Oscillators are not anti-aliased and control
                voltages are not filtered. This minimizes latency and yields a
                very crisp snappy sound, however, at the cost of introducing
                artifacts when the module is pushed outside of its sweet spot.
                Everything is perfectly in tune as harmonics and sub-harmonics
                of the base pitch. This is achieved by stacking oscillators in
				<em>just intonation</em> instead of the more traditional <em>equal
				temperament</em>. Thus, some of the sounds and progressions might
                sound alien and strange at times.
